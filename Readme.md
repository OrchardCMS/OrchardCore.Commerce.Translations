# Orchard Core Commerce Translations

All the localization files used for [Orchard Core Commerce](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Commerce). As a package, it's avaiable from two sources:

- The NuGet packages match the [`OrchardCore.Commerce`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OrchardCore.Commerce/) package of the same version. These are manually published from the [`main`](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Commerce.Translations/tree/main) branch.
- The Cloudsmith packages are automatically published whever the repository is synchronized with Crowdin and has new data. The versions are not aligned, you can use the latest Translations and Commerce packages together.
